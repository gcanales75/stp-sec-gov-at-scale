1. In this lab, we will use the previous Redshift query editor version, so please click on **old query editor** from the blue banner at the top of the page.

1. In the **Connect to database** dialog box, update fields with this parameters:

	| Key | Value  |
	|---|---|
	| Database name  | psobigdata  |
	|  Database user | awsuser  |
	|  Database password | PsoBigData01  |

1. Click **Connect to database**

1. You will run the below query, but before you run it you need to update the IAM role ARN with the actual AWS account number (ACCOUNT_NUMBER), you will find it in the console upper right corner, it's a 12 digits number. Remove hyphens '-'.

	```
	create external schema tickithistory
	from data catalog
	database 'teamawesome-tickit-history'
	region 'us-west-2'
	iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_NUMBER:role/RedshiftIAMRole1'
	create external database if not exists;
	```

1. Paste the the updated script in the Amazon Redshift query editor text box and run the query.

1. To make sure the external schema has been created, run the following query in the same Query window:

	```
	select * from svv_external_schemas
	```

	You must see a similar output in the below **Rows returned** panel

1. To make sure that your external tables are available for querying, run the following query:

	```
	select * from svv_external_tables
	```

	Below **Rows returned** you must see a list of tables
	
1. Now that you have confirmed that your external tables are accessible, you can run queries from Redshift to Athena databases. 

	*Sample query question*: Using the following query, we will find what were the Top 5 ticket sellers for events in San Diego in 2008?

	```
	select sellerid, username, city, firstname ||' '|| lastname as fullname, sum(qtysold) as qtysold
	from tickithistory.sales, tickithistory.date, tickithistory.users
	where sales.sellerid = users.userid
	and sales.dateid = date.dateid
	and year = 2008
	and city = 'San Diego'
	group by sellerid, username, city, firstname ||' '|| lastname
	order by 5 desc
	limit 5;
	```
