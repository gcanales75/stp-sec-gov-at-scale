1. To do this lab, you will need the Private IP of an Oracle DW deployed in this lab environment, that you will use as the source database to perform a migration to Amazon Redshift, and the public IP of a Windows host which has preinstalled the Schema Convertion Tool (SCT). To obtain these IPs, navigate to the CloudFormation Service (Service *search box* -> CloudFormation)

1. Click on the CloudFormation stack listed

1. Click on the **Outputs** panel

1. Copy and paste the *Oracle DW private IP*, *Windows host public IP* and the *Amazon Redshift endpoint* in a notepad on your computer, you will use them later in this lab and in Lab #3.

1. The *Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)* is preinstalled in the Windows host. Use the below credentials to log in to the instance using any RDP client installed in your computer

	| Key | Value  |
	|---|---|
	| Host IP  | [Windows host public IP]  |
	|  User | Administrator  |
	|  Password | PsoBda2020$Win  |

1. Once logged in, click **Yes**, to allow the windows intance to be network discovered

1. Open the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT), it will take ~1 minute to launch

1. If you see a prompt window asking for a SCT update, select **Not now**

1. Once the *Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)* has launched, in the Menu panel, click on File > New project

1. Update the New project information with the below values

	| Key | Value  |
	|---|---|
	| Project Name  | Convert Oracle DwH to Redshift  |
	|  DB category | Data warehouse (OLAP)  |
	|  Source engine | Oracle DW |
	|  Target engine | Amazon Redshift  |

1. Click **OK**

1. Once in your new project panel, you need to disable **AWS Glue** as the target for stored procedures conversion, click on Settings > Project Settings > Conversion settings > Use AWS Glue (UNCHECK)

	<img src="../images/uncheck-glue.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

1. Click **OK**

1. Click on **Connect to Oracle DW**

1. You will need the Oracle DW private IPv4 recorded in this lab's step 6. Update the connection information with the below values:

	| Key | Value  |
	|---|---|
	| Server name  | [Oracle DW private IP]  |
	|  Server port | 1521  |
	|  Oracle SID | xe |
	|  User name | TICKITDWH  |
	|  Password | tickit#2020$dw  |

1. Click **OK**

1. An SSL security warning will show in the screen, since this a lab environment we can proceed without configuring a secure SSL connection.

1. Click on **Connect to Amazon Redshift**. Update the connection information with the below values:

	| Key | Value  |
	|---|---|
	| Server name  | [Amazon Redshift endpoint]  |
	|  Server port | 5439 |
	|  Database | psobigdata |
	|  User name | awsuser |
	|  Password | PsoBigData01 |

1. Click **OK**

1. From the **Oracle DW** pane on the left-hand side, DE-SELECT all of the items in the list

1. In the same pane, click to select the **TICKITDWH** schema

1. Right-click on the **TICKITDWH** schema and select “Convert Schema”

1. If prompted, select “Yes” to replace objects if they exist in the target and “Collect and Continue” if prompted about statistics.

1. From the right-hand pane, expand the **TICKITDWH** schema and you should see your tables and views have been created in your Redshift Database.

You have now successfully converted your Oracle Data Warehouse schema to Redshift—in the next lab, we are going to migrate the actual data from your Oracle data warehouse to Redshift.
